## Description
This is an attempt to port the Afonso F's Jenkins material theme (http://afonsof.com/jenkins-material-theme/) to use Theme Manager plugin (https://github.com/jenkinsci/theme-manager-plugin#configuring-the-plugin).
This should allow Jenkins administrators to easily switch themes and allow users to select their own theme.

## Installation
To install this theme search for 'Material theme' in your Jenkins update center.

## Configuration
Go to the "Configure System" page, search for 'Built-in Themes' and select 'Material - Indigo' or 'Material - Red'

Or with the [configuration-as-code](https://github.com/jenkinsci/configuration-as-code-plugin) plugin:

```yaml
unclassified:
  themeManager:
    disableUserThemes: true
    theme: "material-indigo" # or 'material-red' or 'material-grey' or 'material-light-blue'
```

## Running (development)
To build and run this plugin you should only need to run:
```
mvn clean hpi:run
```

## Development tools
Here is a list of the tools (and versions) I have in my development enviornment - outside of those handeled in the pom.xml.
Java 11
Maven 3.5


## Releasing
To release a new version of this plugin, please follow these steps: 
https://www.jenkins.io/doc/developer/publishing/releasing/

## Disclaimer
I am not a front-end web or Java developer. The CCS in the project has mostly been copied from http://afonsof.com/jenkins-material-theme/. The Java in this project has modified from the dark theme plugin (https://github.com/jenkinsci/dark-theme-plugin). 

## Future work
- Add the ability for users to define custom theme pallets.
- Need to add tests to check:
  - That when a theme is loaded through the UI, that the correct theme is loaded.
